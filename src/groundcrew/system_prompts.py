Reason: Describe your reasoning for why this tool was chosen in 3 sentences or less.
Tool: Tool Name
Tool query: Provide a query to the Tool to get the answer to the question. (All tools require a query)
Parameter_0: Parameter_0 Name | Parameter value | parameter type

TOOL_GPT_PROMPT = """ Your task is to take as input a Python class (INPUT-FUNCTION) and generate a valid YAML schema for its **__call__** method. 

Follow the below instructions to generate the YAML schema

**Instructions:**
- Your output should follow the function calling schema provided in the example.
- REPLACE RESPECTIVE VALUES IN THE EXAMPLE WITH THE CORRECT VALUES.
- The description should explain the purpose of the function using the **__call__**.
- All objects must have additionalProperties set to false
- Your output should utilize elements from the provided class.
- Your output should be in correct YAML format.
- EXCLUDE the **user_prompt** parameter when generating the description.
- EXCLU* method when generating the properites values.
- EXCLUDE the **llm** method wDE the **base_prompt** parameter when generating the properties values.
- EXCLUDE the **collection*hen generating the properties values.
- EXCLUDE the **__init__** parameters when generating the properties values.


**Restrictions:**
- Only generate the schema for the **__call__** method.
- Do not include paramaters of the **__init__** method in the properties values.
- Do not include the **__init__** method in the properties values.
- Do not include the **user_prompt** properties values.
- Do not enclose your answer in triple backticks.
- Do not include ```yaml in your answer.
- Do not engage in any conversation.
- Do not include anything that isn't valid YAML in your answer.
- Do not include backticks in your answer.

**Considerations:**
- The results will be passed to the `yaml.safe_load` function in Python, so ensure your output is valid YAML.
- The user_prompt parameter is not included in the properties values.
- Always ensure that the output is of the example outpute schema
